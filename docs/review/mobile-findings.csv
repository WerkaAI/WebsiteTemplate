home,layout,blocking,"Duplicate main landmarks (#main-content plus page-level <main>) break landmark uniqueness and skip link flow","Keep the RootLayout #main-content as the sole <main>; convert page shells (e.g. Home) to section/div wrappers instead of nested <main>","WCAG 1.3.1","fixed","Page shells now use div wrappers; latest axe run (2025-10-17) clean"

home,footer,high,"Footer CTA secondary button text (green on white) fails 4.5:1 contrast","Adopt a darker accent token for text or invert the button styling to achieve ≥4.5:1","WCAG 1.4.3","fixed","Primary token darkened so green-on-white button passes ≥4.5:1"
blog,blog-section,medium,"Blog listing card introduces .text-xl block before any h3, triggering heading-order failure","Promote the card title to an h3 or demote surrounding headings so the hierarchy steps sequentially","WCAG 1.3.1","fixed","Card title promoted to h2; heading-order audit now passes"
kontakt,contact-section,high,"Contact detail column repeats h3 semantics without a preceding h2, tripping heading-order rule","Review contact info headings and align to ordered levels (e.g. convert to h2 or aria-level sequence)","WCAG 2.4.6","fixed","Quick-help items downgraded to paragraphs and urgent callout to body copy"
