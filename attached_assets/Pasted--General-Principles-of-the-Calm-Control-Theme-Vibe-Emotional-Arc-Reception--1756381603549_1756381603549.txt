# General Principles of the **“Calm & Control”** Theme

## Vibe & Emotional Arc

* **Reception**: calm, professional, supportive, modern.
* **Scrolling experience**: from light “chaos” to “control” (progressively cleaner, fewer stimuli).
* **Tone**: little shouting, lots of breathing space. One clear focal point at a time.

## Colors (Palette & Purpose)

* **MAIN GREEN #006625** – brand color; accents, headings/CTAs, guiding the eye.
* **SECONDARY GREEN #16A34A** – subtle highlights and “ok” states.
* **BLACKOUT #090909** – main strong texts/headlines.
* **STONE #313847** – secondary text, descriptions, delicate lines.
* **ALMOST WHITE #F9FAFB** – dominant background, sense of cleanliness and space.
* **ACCENT ORANGE #FD7E14** – only for warnings/legal notices (never CTAs or decoration).

**Rule**: neutral base; green used sparingly and purposefully.

## Typography 

* Typeface: **Inter**; if unavailable, a modern sans-serif (e.g., Helvetica/Arial).
* Headlines bold and clear, body text simple and readable.
* Avoid decorative or “shouting” fonts.
* Short paragraphs, bullet lists, easy scanning. Comfortable line spacing.

---

## Layout & Space

* Lots of white space and air. Breathing sections, clearly separated.
* Light separators instead of heavy frames. No element overload.
* Clear hierarchy: one dominant element per screen. 

---

## Icons

* Minimalist line art, no gradients or shadows.
* Colors: #006625, #16A34A, STONE.
* Consistent proportions and line weights.

---

## Shapes & Layers

* Slightly rounded corners, soft and low shadows.
* Thin, subtle dividers; prioritize space over frames.

---

## Motion

* Subtle, intentional, brief. Gentle fades/slides.
* No “decorative loops” or aggressive effects.
* Respect user motion-reduction preferences.

---

## Accessibility & Clarity

* High text contrast, visible focus states, comfortable click targets.
* Avoid long text blocks and decorative distractions.

## Do / Don’t

**Do:**

* Limited palette, lots of space, calm storytelling from “chaos to control.”
* Use green to guide attention, not as background fill.

**Don’t:**

* No flashy accents, heavy gradients, or overstimulating carousels.
* No stocky fake smiles; orange only for alerts.
